    <p>Sarawakian cuisine is a regional cuisine of Malaysia. Like the rest of Malaysian cuisine, Sarawak food is based
        on staples such as rice. 
        <br>
        There is also a great variety of other ingredients and food preparations due to the
        influence of the state's varied geography and indigenous cultures quite distinct from the regional cuisines of
        the Peninsular Malaysia.
