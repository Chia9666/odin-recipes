    <h2>Fried Rice from Malaysia</h2>
    <p> A plate of hot cooked white rice is always our preferred starch base in most of our meals — in some regions,
        locals take a meal with rice for breakfast, and others for lunch and dinner.</p>

        not only work as a tasty dish but look vibrant and lively as well.</p>
