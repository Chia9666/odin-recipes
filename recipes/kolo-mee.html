        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large wok over medium high heat. Add 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil and add in the onion flakes.<br>
                Lightly fry for about a minute by continuously stirring the onion flakes until golden brown (but not burnt).
                Turn off the heat, and transfer the flakes into a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Using the same wok, turn the heat to medium high and add in 1/2 Tbsp oil, shallots and garlic. Fry until
                lightly fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crank the heat up to high and add in the ground pork, breaking it up into small pieces. Cook for about
                5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add in chicken bouillon powder, fish sauce, soy sauce, and white pepper. Mix to incorporate everything
                together. Turn off the heat and transfer the meat to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pot of water and let it come to a boil. Add in the egg noodles and cook according to
                package directions, about 2-3 minutes, or until al dente.<br>
                 Pour the noodles into a colander and rinse under cold water. Drain noodles and portion into serving bowls.</li>
            <li>Top the noodles with the 2-3 heaping tablespoons of the warm ground pork mixture, green onions, sliced
                BBQ pork (char siu), wontons, pickled chilies, and fried onion flakes.</li>
            <li>Mix the bowl thoroughly to coat the noodles and serve immediately.</li>
